# Landmark Explorer

Landmark Explorer is a SwiftUI-based application that lets you explore iconic landmarks around the world using MapKit. With an interactive fullscreen map, you can select landmarks from a dropdown, animate the map to their coordinates, and dive into detailed views with images, descriptions, and more.

## Features

- **Fullscreen Map:** Displays a dynamic map with *hardcoded landmarks*.
- **Custom Annotations:** Each landmark is marked with a custom annotation pin on the map.
-  **Interactive Landmark Selection:**
    - Use the dropdown menu at the top to choose a landmark and the map camera will smoothly animate to its exact location.  
    - Tap an annotation (marker) on the map to focus on that landmark and the map camera will move accordingly. The selected annotation will scale larger than the others to indicate it's been selected.
    - Use the "Next" button to cycle through landmarks, with the map camera animating to each location.  
- **Landmark Preview:** A preview pane at the bottom shows the landmark's name and location, with a "Read More" and "Next" button.
- **Detailed Information:** Tapping "Read More" brings up a sheet with pictures, a detailed description, a link to Wikipedia, and a focused map view.
- **Dark Mode Support:** The app adapts seamlessly to light and dark mode.
- **Universal Compatibility:** Works on both **iPhone** and **iPad**.
- **Orientation Support:** 
    - **iPhone**: Portrait only
    - **iPad**: Supports all orientations
